# Saved things

A signed-in person keeps their own favorites, saved trips, preferences and trip journal. Every endpoint here starts with `Sessioning.use`, which returns the person or refuses with NOT_SIGNED_IN, and acts on that person only: nobody can read or change another person's things, because no endpoint takes a person as an input.

The [my-things request](reaction:Saved.Mine.ShowMine) carries the session and answers with everything the person has kept: [their favorites](former:Saved.Mine.MyFavorites), each with the place's name, kind and floor from `Wayfinding._place`, newest first; [their saved trips](former:Saved.Mine.MyTrips), each with the names of its two places; [their preferences](former:Saved.Mine.MyPreferences); [their recent trips](former:Saved.Mine.MyHistory), newest first, with place names; and [their totals](former:Saved.Mine.MyTotals), the number of finished trips and the estimated metres. Because favorites, trips and journal entries are only ever kept for places on the map, and places are never removed, every one of them is listed.

```endpoints
Saved.Mine.ShowMine at /me
```

[Favoriting a place](reaction:Saved.Favorites.Favorite) carries the session and the place; a place `Wayfinding._place` does not know is refused with NO_SUCH_PLACE before anything is kept, and a place already favorited is refused with ALREADY_FAVORITE. [Unfavoriting](reaction:Saved.Favorites.Unfavorite) carries the same and refuses a place that is not a favorite with NOT_FAVORITE. Both answer with nothing.

```endpoints
Saved.Favorites.Favorite at /me/favorites/add
Saved.Favorites.Unfavorite at /me/favorites/remove
```

[Saving a trip](reaction:Saved.Trips.SaveTrip) carries the session, a name, the two places and the step-free flag, and answers with the trip; a source or destination `Wayfinding._place` does not know is refused with NO_SUCH_PLACE before anything is kept, a name the person already uses is refused with TRIP_NAME_TAKEN and an empty one with EMPTY_TRIP_NAME. [Removing a trip](reaction:Saved.Trips.RemoveTrip) carries the session and the trip and answers with nothing; a trip that is not the person's own is refused with NO_SUCH_TRIP, the same as one that does not exist, so nobody learns about another person's trips.

```endpoints
Saved.Trips.SaveTrip at /me/trips/save
Saved.Trips.RemoveTrip at /me/trips/remove
```

[Setting preferences](reaction:Saved.Preferences.SetPreferences) carries the session and both flags (step-free routes by default, use my location) and answers with nothing. The page applies them when it loads.

```endpoints
Saved.Preferences.SetPreferences at /me/preferences/set
```

When a person reaches the end of a route, the page [records the trip](reaction:Saved.Journal.FinishTrip) with the session, the two places and the distance in metres. The page works out the metres itself before sending them: it adds up the route's step distances and multiplies by 50, because an outdoor walk's distance is 1 plus its metres over 50, and treats indoor steps the same way, so the figure is an estimate and the page says so. The endpoint stores the metres as given. It answers with the entry; an unknown place is refused with NO_SUCH_PLACE and a negative distance with INVALID_DISTANCE. The page sends one finish per route; a repeated request, such as a retry, adds a second entry, which this beta accepts because the totals are estimates.

```endpoints
Saved.Journal.FinishTrip at /me/trips/finish
```
