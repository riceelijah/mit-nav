# Application types

Every person is a Registering user, whether they signed up with a password or signed in with their Commons class account. That user is the one who has a password in Authenticating, the one a Commons account is linked to in CommonsFederating, and the one a session belongs to. The same user is the reporter of a problem, the owner of favorites and saved trips, the traveller in the trip journal, and the person whose preferences are kept.

A problem is always reported about a connection between two places, so a report's target is a Wayfinding link. Favorites, saved trips and journal entries are about Wayfinding places.
