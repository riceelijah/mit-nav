# Wayfinding

## Purpose

Describe how the places in a building connect, so a visitor can be given directions that avoid any passage that is currently unusable.

## Principle

Someone adds the lobby and a room on the second floor and connects them by an elevator and by a staircase. A visitor who needs a step-free route is sent by the elevator, and one who does not is sent by whichever connection is shortest. When the elevator is blocked, the step-free visitor is told that no route exists, while everyone else is still sent by the stairs. Once the elevator is unblocked, it is offered again. A door onto a terrace that is closed overnight is offered during the day and never offered at 2 in the morning.

## Types

```types
Kind is ENTRANCE or HALLWAY or ROOM or TRANSIT
  What sort of place something is, so a visitor can tell a doorway from a destination. A TRANSIT place is only passed through and is never offered as a start or a destination.
```

## State

```state
a set of Places with
  a unique name String
  a kind Kind
  a floor Number

a seq of Links with
  a source Place
  a destination Place
  a forward String
  a backward String
  an accessible Flag
  a blocked Flag
  a closedFrom Number
  a closedUntil Number
  a service String
  a distance Number

  Rule: connections that share the same non-empty service are blocked and unblocked together, because they depend on one thing that can go out of service, such as an elevator
  Rule: a connection is closed from closedFrom up to closedUntil, in hours from 0 up to 24, wrapping past midnight when closedFrom is greater than closedUntil; when the two are equal the connection is never closed
```

## Actions

```actions
addPlace(name: String, kind: Kind, floor: Number) : returns (place: Place)
  where some place has name
  then
    refuses DUPLICATE_PLACE "A place with that name already exists."
  where no place has name
  then
    add a new place with name and kind and floor
    returns place

connect(source: Place, destination: Place, forward: String, backward: String, accessible: Flag, closedFrom: Number, closedUntil: Number, service: String, distance: Number) : returns (link: Link)
  where source not in places or destination not in places
  then
    refuses NO_SUCH_PLACE "Both places must exist before they can be connected."
  where source in places and destination in places
  then
    add a new link with source and destination and forward and backward and accessible and closedFrom and closedUntil and service and distance, not blocked
    returns link

block(link: Link) : returns (link: Link)
  where link not in links
  then
    refuses NO_SUCH_LINK "There is no such connection."
  where link in links and link is blocked
  then
    refuses ALREADY_BLOCKED "That connection is already blocked."
  where link in links and link is not blocked
  then
    mark link as blocked, and every other link with the same non-empty service
    returns link

unblock(link: Link) : returns (link: Link)
  where link not in links
  then
    refuses NO_SUCH_LINK "There is no such connection."
  where link in links and link is not blocked
  then
    refuses NOT_BLOCKED "That connection is not blocked."
  where link in links and link is blocked
  then
    mark link as not blocked, and every other link with the same non-empty service
    returns link
```

## Queries

```queries
_places() : many (place: Place, name: String, kind: Kind, floor: Number)
  Answers every place, ordered by floor and then in the order the places were added (so whoever builds the map can list a floor's places from the entrance outward), and no rows when there are none.
_links() : many (link: Link, sourceName: String, destinationName: String, forward: String, accessible: Flag, blocked: Flag, closedFrom: Number, closedUntil: Number, service: String)
  Answers every connection with the names of its two places, in the order the connections were made.
_route(source: Place, destination: Place, accessibleOnly: Flag, hour: Number) : many (step: Number, link: Link, instruction: String, placeName: String, floor: Number)
  Answers the shortest route from source to destination, where each connection costs the distance it was given when it was made (so a builder can make a short flight of stairs cheaper than waiting for an elevator), as numbered steps starting at 1, never using a blocked connection or one that is closed at the given hour of the day (0 up to 24, so 6.5 is half past six in the morning), and when accessibleOnly is true never using a connection that is not accessible. Answers no rows when either place is unknown or no route exists, and one row per step in order otherwise. Ties are broken in favor of connections made earlier.
